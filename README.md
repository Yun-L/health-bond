Health Bond is an Android app that allows users to involve trusted individuals to aid in their dieting efforts. The app tracks a user location and notifies the trusted individuals when they may be breaking a dieting routine. The app encourages transparency and open communication within a supporting group, rather than having the user rely solely on self motivation.


The apps/ directory contains the android mobile app of our project while the rest of the repo contains code for the REST API implemented with Flask.
